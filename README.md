# Ken-s_Supplies_Sales_Performance_Analysis
Kenâ€™s Supplies struggled to understand year-over-year sales performance across product subcategories, which made it difficult to optimize inventory, pricing, and future product investments. To address this, I conducted a comprehensive analysis using Tableau, focusing on key business metrics such as sales revenue, profit, and quantity  sold.

To stay competitive in todayâ€™s market, Kenâ€™s Supplies must have a thorough understanding of year over year sales performance and product trends. By analyzing key metrics like sales revenue, profit, and quantity sold across various product subcategories, we can identify growth opportunities and address underperforming areas.

## Data Description

Kenâ€™s Supplies relies on a comprehensive data model to track and analyze sales, profit, and quantity sold across various product subcategories. 
The main table, Orders , serves as the central dataset containing critical fields such as Order ID, Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Customer Information. This table is enriched with data from other sub tables to provide deeper insights into customer demographics, product details, and location based trends.

## Recommendations
Based on my analysis, here are some recommendations to help stakeholders at Kenâ€™s Supplies enhance sales performance in the coming year:

**Focus on underperforming categories** by addressing subcategories such as tables, machines, and bookcases that have shown notable losses. Investigate potential causes such as pricing, product quality, or fluctuations in demand, and take corrective action to improve profitability.

**Leverage high-performing subcategories** by capitalising on those that have demonstrated strong growth in sales and profit. Increase stock levels, introduce targeted promotions, or expand marketing activity to stimulate further growth in these areas.

**Optimise pricing strategy** by reviewing pricing structures for both high- and low-performing products. Use insights from weekly sales trends and average performance to set competitive prices that maximise profit without compromising sales volume.

**Use sales trend data to optimise stock management**, ensuring that high-demand products are well-stocked while reducing inventory for underperforming items to avoid surplus stock.

**Implement targeted marketing campaigns** focusing on product subcategories that have shown consistent growth or steady demand throughout the year, directing efforts towards the customer segments most responsive to these products.

**Offer product bundles** that combine high-margin items with lower-performing products to encourage multiple purchases, thereby improving overall sales performance across a broader product range.

**Utilise customer segmentation insights** to personalise offers and promotions. Tailor product mixes, pricing, and discounts to the preferences of specific customer segments to increase engagement and sales.

**Leverage cross-selling and upselling strategies** by promoting complementary products within high-demand categories, increasing the total transaction value per customer.
